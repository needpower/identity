You can also optionally set `pathPrefix`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
  pathPrefix: "/gatsby-advanced-starter", // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-advanced-starter/.
}
```

WARNING: Make sure to edit `static/robots.txt` to include your domain for the sitemap!
